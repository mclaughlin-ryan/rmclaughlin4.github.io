## Medical Device Projects

### Artifical Aortic Heart Valve

An engineering course project, this heart valve was designed as a group effort with the goal of achieving natural valve hemodynamics and a durable implant using a trileaflet architecture and wear-resistant materials.

### Reconstructive Breast Implant

This reconstructive breast implant was designed and developed with fellow engineering students for a senior course project. With the goal of providing breast reconstruction to patients who had undergone a mastectomy operation, this implant was developed by the curing of silicone in a 3D printed mold to form a single-lumen shell capable of retaining fluid and withstanding outside stresses.

## Research

### Effect of outdoor particulate matter exposure on the human airway's antibacterial ability

Investigating the impact of air pollution on health, specifically particulate matter, this project focuses on how the human airway's antibacterial properties are affected upon inhalation of particulate matter. Simulating this phenomenon using bench-top methods, samples of particulate matter, bacterial cultures, and antibacterial fluid native to the human airway were intermixed to gain insight into the biological effects of this commonplace occurrence.
