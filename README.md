## Medical Image Analysis Projects

### Retinal Layer Segmentation Tool (Retinal OCT Images)

This project features a software tool that allows segmented layers of the retina in a retinal OCT image to be corrected if inaccurate. Accuracy is important in segmenting (or marking out) the layers of the retina as the layers can be studied to detect morphological changes that may be indicative of ocular disease.

The retinal OCT image on the left and a layer thickness map on the right with a segmentation correction feature shown. The correction feature allows the user to choose a point on the retinal image where the segmentation is in error and correct outward from that point at a particular radial distance, as shown on the thickness map. The thickness map, showing a straight-on view of the retina, illustrates the thickness, or number of pixels, in a retinal layer. Brighter shades indicate thicker areas and darker shades indicate thinner areas.

The image above shows a drawing tool that can be used to correct segmentation. The retinal OCT image is on the left and an average pixel value map, representing the average value of the pixels in that layer, is on the right. The user can draw on the average pixel map, or projection image, to indicate the area of faulty segmentation or anatomical structures that may be responsible for such error. As can be seen, this area then appears on the left side to mark the region where the layer segmentation is not accurate.

### Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring (Calcium Agatston Scoring)

This project features a software module that quantifies the amount of calcium within the coronary arteries on CT scans. The calcium score corresponds to the severity of disease and a measure of risk for an adverse cardiac event. The previously developed module allowed calcium scoring for normal-radiation CT scans, and I had added features to allow scoring for low-radiation CT scans to support lower radiation exposure to patients.



The image above is of the modified module with a scan and scoring selections on the left.



Coronary artery marking labels, where each color corresponds to a different artery branch that, if being bright enough in the scan and thus indicating calcification, can be manually marked by the respective label to factor into the calcium score.

## Medical Device Projects

### Artifical Aortic Heart Valve

An engineering course project, this heart valve was designed as a group effort with the goal of achieving natural valve hemodynamics and a durable implant using a trileaflet architecture and wear-resistant materials.

### Reconstructive Breast Implant

This reconstructive breast implant was designed and developed with fellow engineering students for a senior course project. With the goal of providing breast reconstruction to patients who had undergone a mastectomy operation, this implant was developed by the curing of silicone in a 3D printed mold to form a single-lumen shell capable of retaining fluid and withstanding outside stresses.

## Research

### Effect of outdoor particulate matter exposure on the human airway's antibacterial ability

Investigating the impact of air pollution on health, specifically in regard to particulate matter, this project focuses on how the human airway's antibacterial properties are affected upon inhalation of this type of ambient substance. Simulating such a phenomenon using bench-top methods, samples of particulate matter, bacterial cultures, and antibacterial fluid native to the human airway were intermixed to gain insight into the biological effects of this process.
