## Medical Image Analysis Projects

### Retinal Layer Segmentation Tool (Retinal OCT Images)

This project features a software tool that allows segmented layers of the retina in a retinal OCT image to be corrected if inaccurate. Accuracy is important in segmenting (or marking out) the layers of the retina as the layers can be studied to detect morphological changes that may be indicative of ocular disease.

The image above shows the user interface with a retinal OCT image slice and segmented retinal layers in blue.

</p>

This image shows a segmentation correction feature with the retinal OCT image on the left and a layer thickness map on the right. The correction feature allows the user to choose a point on the retinal image where the segmentation is in error and correct outwards from that point for a particular radial distance, as shown on the thickness map. The thickness map, showing a straight-on view of the retina, illustrates the thickness, or number of pixels, in a retinal layer. Brighter shades indicate thicker areas and darker shades indicate thinner areas.

</p>

This image shows a drawing tool that can be used to correct the segmentation. The retinal OCT image is on the left and an average pixel value map, representing the average value of the pixels in that layer, is on the right. The user can draw on the average pixel map, or projection image, to indicate the area of faulty segmentation or anatomical structures that may be responsible for such error. As can be seen, this area then appears on the left side to mark the region where the layer segmentation is not accurate.

## Medical Device Projects

### Artifical Aortic Heart Valve

An engineering course project, this heart valve was designed as a group effort with the goal of achieving natural valve hemodynamics and a durable implant using a trileaflet architecture and wear-resistant materials.

### Reconstructive Breast Implant

This reconstructive breast implant was designed and developed with fellow engineering students for a senior course project. With the goal of providing breast reconstruction to patients who had undergone a mastectomy operation, this implant was developed by the curing of silicone in a 3D printed mold to form a single-lumen shell capable of retaining fluid and withstanding outside stresses.

### Effect of outdoor particulate matter exposure on the human airway's antibacterial ability

Investigating the impact of air pollution on health, specifically in regard to particulate matter, this project focuses on how the human airway's antibacterial properties are affected upon inhalation of this type of ambient substance. Simulating such a phenomenon using bench-top methods, samples of particulate matter, bacterial cultures, and antibacterial fluid native to the human airway were intermixed to gain insight into the biological effects of this process.
